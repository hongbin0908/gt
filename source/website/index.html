<h1>Presentation</h1>

<p><b>GeniusTrader</b> aims to be a <b>full featured toolbox to create
<em>trading systems</em></b>. Powerful systematic trading requires
several things :
<ul>
<li>many indicators and corresponding signals</li>
<li>money management rules
    <ul>
    <li>deciding what is a reasonable amount of money to put on a single trade
        (to limit the risk associated to that trade)</li>
    <li>combining different values within the portfolio
        (to limit the global risk)</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>flexibility to be able to test all combinations with the above items</li>
<li>backtesting system with analysis of results</li>
</ul>

<p>GeniusTrader already has support of most of this. GeniusTrader consists
of a bunch of perl modules associated to a few perl scripts. It
has no graphical user interface since it's absolutely not needed to achieve
its goals ... 

<p>Here's an <a href="examples/report.html">example of a backtest report</a>
that GeniusTrader can generate for you (once you created your trading
system by defining its rules). GeniusTrader can nevertheless generate
graphics that can be used to help you create your trading system. It can 
generate fully customized <a href="screenshots.html">graphics</a> and it can 
also display the evolution of a portfolio during a backtest.  Those
graphics help a lot to realize the weaknesses of your
trading systems :
<ul>
<li>big max draw down</li>
<li>long period without new high (very frustrating when
    you're playing with real money)</li>
<li>no regular gains (only one very good trade made most of the profits)</li>
</ul>

<h1>Going further ...</h1>

<p>What you read looked interesting and you want to try ? Okay, that's why it's free software.
However let me warn you : GeniusTrader is not meant to be used by typical end-users, you
should really know a bit of Perl and if you want to use it, you'll have to understand how
it works (by reading the docs and the API). That said, we can help you in that direction...
you'll find everything needed below.

<h2>Obtaining source code</h2>

<p>The code is managed via <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a>. 
You can always download tarballs (generated on the fly):
<ul>
<li>Development tree
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geniustrader.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/GT.tar.gz?view=tar">Perl modules</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.geniustrader.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/Scripts.tar.gz?view=tar">Perl scripts</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stable tree: there's no stable tree, use the development one, it's
working fine.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The subversion repository is available via anonymous access:
<pre>
$ svn co https://devel.geniustrader.org:8082/svn/trunk/GT
$ svn co https://devel.geniustrader.org:8082/svn/trunk/Scripts
</pre>
<p>You can also <a href="/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/trunk/">browse the subversion tree online</a>. You can use the code
under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public License</a>
(version 2 or, at your option, any later version).
<p>
Once you have the code you still have to go through some steps to have
a working installation to play with. <a href="first_use.html">Follow the
instructions</a>.

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>GeniusTrader is already usable but it still evolves at a rapid pace with
regular changes resulting in breakage in other parts of the code. Contributions
are always welcome because we always have more ideas than time to
implement them. :-)

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>Beware: I added spaces in the emails below to avoid a bit of spam.</p>

<p>The coordination of the development happens on a mailing list
(devel &#64; geniustrader.org). You're invited to join and to participate in the
discussions. Just send "subscribe devel your&#64;email" to
<a href="mailto:sympa &#64; geniustrader.org">sympa &#64; geniustrader.org</a>. That's where
you submit patches and ideas for improving GeniusTrader. Also you can
probably find some help over there (in particular if you want to
contribute later)...</p>

<p>If you're not interested in the development of GeniusTrader but
you have a strong interest in systematic trading, then you're
welcome to join system-traders &#64; geniustrader.org where you can
exchange your ideas and research with other people. To subscribe
to it, please send "subscribe system-traders your&#64;email" to
<a href="mailto:sympa &#64; geniustrader.org">sympa &#64; geniustrader.org</a>.</p>

<p>Both lists are archived on the web:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.geniustrader.org/lists/devel/">devel &#64; geniustrader.org</a> (<a href="http://www.geniustrader.org/lists/devel/index2.html">same without SVN commit notices</a>)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.geniustrader.org/lists/system-traders/">system-traders &#64; geniustrader.org</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>GeniusTrader internals</h2>

<p>There is no good documentation giving an overview of GeniusTrader internals.
However each object is documented in the source code (with POD) and you can browse
the <a href="doc/GT/">API</a> to learn more about it. In order to help you have
a global view of GeniusTrader before digging into it, you can watch this schema:
<p align="center">
<img src="gt-internals.png" alt="Gross overview of GeniusTrader architecture" width="700" height="367">
<p>
You should also know that each customizable object has access to
various informations including many indicators, signals and whatever
can be computed with history of prices and volume (and possibly some
external meta-data information). Keep in mind that this representation
of GeniusTrader's architecture is incomplete and is not always 100%
accurate (some simplifications have been made), but it gives you a good
overview of how things are working together.

<p>Have fun, we hope to see you soon, we'd enjoy your contribution !
